# technobrawl
Technobrawl is a fast-paced, top-down arena shooter where players pilot customizable mechs, battling for weapons and power-ups in a relentless storm of bullets, lasers, and explosions. With the entire map always visible on a single screen, the action is instant, the chaos is constant, and only the best pilots will dominate the battlefield.

## Ignored Directory
When testing the game objects and their interactions, you will need to use a game scene.
To avoid merge conflicts, we will use an **Ignored** directory in which each of us can have our own scenes for testing.
As these scenes will not be pushed, be sure to have all your work in prefabs, scripts, and scriptable objects.
